A Convolutional Neural Network based model to predict the peptide binding sites in proteins.
## Data Files
The data files contain sample preprocessed protein data (details found in the JTB paper).
- train_7_set.csv and train_labels.txt
- val_7_set.csv and val_labels.txt
- test_7_set.csv and test_labels.txt
## Code Files
- experiment.py (This is the main file. Run this to start running the experiment.)
- models.py (This contains the model structure and details.)
- dataset.py (This file loads datasets.)
## Guide
Put all these files in one folder and run the experiment.py file.
The experiment will continue running iterations until you manually stop/kill it.
